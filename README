GPU enabled version of Ascot5 - Work in Progress

=== COMPILE

Warning: for some reasons the function mccc_coefs_mufun does not compile for the GPU if some optimization is active. 
In order to enable the full function define -DFULLMCCC (see the Makefile)

All SIMD specific directives have been disabled. It is not clear their behaviour on the GPU. 
In order to enable them define -DSIMD (see the Makefile)

In order to compile on the GPU:
1) modify the Makefile according to the indications writen in the file
2) make ascot5_main MPI=0 VERBOSE=0 GPU=1 OMP=1 TARGET=1

In order to compile for the CPU (with or without SIMD)
1) modify the Makefile according to the indications writen in the file
2) make ascot5_main MPI=0 VERBOSE=0 GPU=0 OMP=1 TARGET=1

=== RUN

Specific setup for Triton

module load cuda
module load openmpi
module load gcc/9.2.0-cuda-nvptx
module load hdf5

In order to run OpenMP on the CPU:
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=N
srun -n 1 --cpus-per-task=N ./ascot5_main --in=helloworld

In order to run OpenMP on the GPU:
srun --gres=gpu:1 ./ascot5_main --in=helloworld

=== THREADING

Set the number of teams and threads per team defining at the beginning of simulate.c
#define NTEAMS 1
#define NTHREADS 1
